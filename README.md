## Key Findings:

### Occupancy Metrics:

 **Occupancy Rate (OCC):** The average occupancy rate over the specified period is 58.61 %. This indicates the efficiency of room utilization.

### Revenue Metrics:

**Total Revenue:** The total revenue generated during the period is $856M. This includes both rooms revenue and other sources.

**ADR (Average Daily Rate):** The average daily rate is 142.06. This reflects the average revenue generated per room sold.

### Operating Performance:

**Gross Operating Income (%):** The gross operating income represents 27.27 % of total revenue, highlighting the efficiency of operations in covering departmental expenses.

**Net Operating Income (%):** After accounting for FF&E reserves, the net operating income is -5.55 % of total revenue, indicating profitability after all operating expenses.

### Profitability and Cost Management:

**EBITDA (%):** EBITDA is 13 % of total revenue, providing insight into overall business profitability before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization.

**Gross Operating Profit (%):** The gross operating profit is 8.50 % of total revenue, showing the effectiveness of managing both departmental and undistributed expenses.

### Expense Analysis:

**Total Departmental Expenses:** The total departmental expenses incurred during the period are $623M, providing insights into operational costs.
